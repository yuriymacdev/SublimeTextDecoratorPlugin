**How to install**

Place the `StringDecorator.py` and `Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` files in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/`
If `.sublime-keymap` file is already there, merge their contents.

Now, when pressing Command+B, the selected piece of text should get decorated with the `{% trans %}` and `{% endtrans %}` strings.
